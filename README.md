# AutoMirror - seamless textures of any form
How-to:
1. Select your tile (any form).
2. Copy it (Ctrl+C) - thus creating the first mirror.
3. Paste it (Ctrl+V) and place the neigobour tile.
4. Paste and do #3 again, or Deselect (Esc key) to confirm a mirror.
5. Draw over any of mirrored tiles, you'll see changes appear in other mirrors.
6. Press "Finish" to remove all mirrors and start over.
7. Close AutoMirror window to kill the script.

Known problems:
- doesn't work with multiple images, you must Finish before copypasting on other images

TODO:
- extended statistics -- quality of life
- multiple groups -- for seamless tiles of different neighbor variation
- automatic mirror search -- continue work, or multiediting
